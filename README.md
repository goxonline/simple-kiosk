***This script transforms a basic Debian Linux 13 installation into an HTML kiosk.***

**Among the things it has**

Requires a basic Debian installation without a traffic environment. The Fluxbox graphical environment and Firefox ESR will be installed.

In the next update, I will prepare the script to transform it into either a kiosk or a basic Digital Signage player. 

Usage:

chmod +x creat.sh
./creat.sh
